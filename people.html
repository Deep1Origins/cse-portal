<p style="text-align:justify"> Dr. Neeraj Mishra is employed as an Assistant Professor in the  Department of Sociology at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) at Indore,  Madhya Pradesh in India since January 2013. Before joining IIT Indore, he was  employed as 'post-doctoral researcher' in the department of Geography, Planning  and International Development Studies, at the University of Amsterdam in The  Netherlands, where he worked for about three years on the issues of urban water  systems in Maharashtra, from April, 2010 till December, 2012. <br>
  Before coming to Amsterdam, he completed his PhD in Development  Studies (<em>Magna cum Laude</em>) from the  Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn, Germany in February  2010 as a DAAD scholar. <br>
  As a postdoc researcher at the University of Amsterdam, he was  part of the project studying the scope and limitations of embedding spatial  information tools in urban governance networks of recently urbanizing Indian  cities. This research delved deeper into the urban question provided a gestalt  to study the dynamics of knowledge politics in the governance of urban water resource  published as a paper in the 'Environment and Urbanization-Asia' journal. <br>
  Due to growing urbanization in India in the coming decades more  and more people would shift to the cities, new social questions would emerge  and need to be discussed in the public sphere. The project shared its findings  with the municipal commissioners of the three selected cities and has produced  policy relevant publications. Along with this research, he was responsible for  teaching the course called 'Introduction to Development Studies&rsquo;. <br>
Anthropology of development and aid in the water sector was also  the area of research for the PhD. This thesis, called- 'a watershed in  watershed governance: democracy and depoliticization of development in India'  studied two internationally funded watershed development projects in India, to  observe that the transformation of institutions and discourses within which  watershed development takes place, and argued that the governance of water in  India has reached a 'watershed moment'. To study this transformation, the  thesis operationalized the concept of depoliticization building on the works of  Habermas and his idea of the structural transformation of the public sphere,  and the works James Ferguson on Lesotho. This study explains how the everyday  governance at the village and project level takes shape and the wider  implications of this process in the field of natural resource management from  the theoretical standpoint of depoliticization. It made recommendations for  reducing water scarcity and its sustainable governance in the water  scarce regions of India. The thesis was published as a book by SVH Press, Germany. </p>
